# Contributor Guidelines

As an open source project, `lhl` welcomes contributions of many forms.

Examples of contributions include:

* Code improvements
* Documentation improvements
* Bug reports and fixes
* Feature requests and implementations
* Code reviews

As an open source project it also means that no one is entitled to nobody elses
time to work on this, hence:

* Bug fixes `>` bug reports
* Feature implementations `>` feature reqests
* (A chain of) small changes `>` one big pull request (e.g. [stacked pull requests](https://graysonkoonce.com/stacked-pull-requests-keeping-github-diffs-small/), individual commits in a single PR do not count)
* As much context as possible in issue/pull request.

All of this will help approve a feature or a bug fix faster.

## Code of Conduct

This project is too small to warrant a formal code of conduct. However, any
disrespectful behaviour related to this project will result in ban from
interacting with the repo and other contributors.
